# gm82chunk
This is a dynamic room loading extension designed for the Game Maker 8.2 ecosystem.

Currently it's intended to optimize games that have too many rooms by loading and executing rooms in gm82save format v2 in the same project they're from, but in the future we plan to allow loading parts of rooms into the current room - the actual chunk system.

Thanks to BPzeBanshee for designing a working proof of concept.
