# gm82chunk
This is a dynamic room loading extension designed for the Game Maker 8.2 ecosystem.

Designed to optimize games with functionality to dynamically load rooms in gm82save format v2/v3, and also contains functions to load and manipulate chunk files exported from gm82room.

Currently a work in progress. Thanks to BPzeBanshee for designing a working proof of concept.
